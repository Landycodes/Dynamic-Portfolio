                Hello! My name is Andrew and I am an aspiring web developer located in Tucson, AZ. I started coding about 6 months ago through tutorial websites such as freecodecamp and TwilioQuest. I am also currently attending a college bootcamp to further my skills. My goal is to be sufficent enough at programming to build my own websites and software from scratch. I also aim to achieve an employable amount of knowledge in web development to secure a job doing something in which I am interested in. I love learning and I am excited for the future!
            </p>
            <p>
                My hobbies and interests outside of coding are Skateboarding, fixing things like cars or smartphones, hiking, and I enjoy watching Anime in my free time. I have been Skateboarding for about 14 years. I enjoy the challange of learning new tricks or doing something I haven't done yet. I was a mechanic for a Nissan and a Toyota dealership for about 2 years doing basic maintence for vehicles like oil changes and tire rotations. Now I fix smartphones at the mall doing common repairs like fixing broken screens and replacing batteries. I always enjoy working a job where I am interested in the work I perform. And lastly my favorite Anime is Code Geass. I find the Charactor growth and hero/villian dynamics in the show fascinating!
